# Phase 20 Fix RA-06-08 Question Admin Knowledge Binding Completion Evidence

**Task id:** `phase-20-fix-ra-06-08-question-admin-knowledge-binding-completion`

**Branch:** `codex/phase-20-fix-ra-06-08-question-admin-knowledge-binding-completion`

## Summary

- Result: validation passed; pre-commit closeout pending.
- Scope: implementation.
- Changed surfaces: question admin UI direct knowledge_node/tag binding inputs, focused UI test, task plan/evidence, and governance state.
- Gates: startup readiness, claim readiness, TDD RED/GREEN, full unit, e2e, quality gate, build, readiness, naming, diff check, and git inventory passed. In-app Browser/IAB failed due local Windows sandbox startup failure.
- Forbidden scope (`forbiddenScope`): `.env.local`, `.env.example`, package/lockfile/dependency, `src/db/schema/**`, `drizzle/**`, schema/migration, staging/prod/cloud/deploy/real provider, external service config, destructive data operation, and `drizzle-kit push` remain blocked.
- Residual gaps (`residualGaps`): no IAB browser verification because local Browser runtime failed twice with `windows sandbox failed: spawn setup refresh`; Playwright e2e passed as fallback.

## Human Approval

- 2026-05-31: user requested the recommended task and approved required permission, commit, merge to `master`, push `origin/master`, and short-lived branch cleanup.
- Approval is limited by the task boundary: reuse existing `question_knowledge_node` / `question_tag` local model for question admin knowledge binding closure.
- Schema/migration changes remain blocked by the task-specific forbidden scope; if required, this task must stop and record blocked evidence.

## Startup Recovery

- `git fetch origin`: pass.
- `git status --short --branch`: `## master...origin/master` before branch creation.
- `git rev-list --left-right --count master...origin/master`: `0 0`.
- HEAD/origin/master: `97a1872 docs(agent): close admin account security policy task`.
- Local short-lived branches before task branch: none.
- Worktrees: `D:/tiku` only.
- Phase 20 queue count: total 52, completed 36, remaining 16, closed 36, pending 14, blocked 2, active 0, done 0, pushed 0.
- Created branch: `codex/phase-20-fix-ra-06-08-question-admin-knowledge-binding-completion`.
- `project-state.yaml` drift: repository SHA still pointed at `d23eead...`; Git reality is `97a1872...`.

## TDD Log

- RED: added a focused UI test requiring a content admin to edit durable `knowledgeNodePublicIds` and `tagPublicIds` from the question form, submit `PATCH /api/v1/questions/{publicId}`, and see updated bindings in the row. The test failed because the form did not expose those inputs.
- GREEN: extended the form state with bounded publicId-list text inputs, initialized them from existing DTO arrays, normalized whitespace/comma-separated values into camelCase DTO arrays, and reused the existing authenticated question update runtime.

## Implementation Notes

- Added manual knowledge_node and tag binding inputs to `AdminQuestionMaterialManagement`.
- Reused existing `question_knowledge_node` / `question_tag` persistence through `PATCH /api/v1/questions/{publicId}`; no schema, migration, drizzle, package, lockfile, env, cloud, deploy, real provider, or destructive data work was performed.

## Security Review

- Verdict: APPROVE within the approved local UI/runtime/test/evidence boundary.
- Files reviewed: `src/features/admin/question-material-management/AdminQuestionMaterialManagementClient.tsx`, `tests/unit/admin-question-material-ui.test.ts`, task plan/evidence, `project-state.yaml`, and `task-queue.yaml`.
- Risk types reviewed: `admin_ops`, `database_migration`, `local_human_verification`, and `evidence_integrity`.
- Abuse cases considered: content admin accidentally sending internal numeric ids; stale admin session token in UI; malformed publicId lists; schema/migration bypass; provider/env/cloud side effects.
- Data exposure review: the UI only accepts and displays `knowledge_node` / `tag` public identifiers; no numeric `id`, session token, secret, raw provider payload, raw prompt, raw answer, or `.env.local` content is exposed.
- Authorization boundary review: the UI continues to call the existing authenticated `PATCH /api/v1/questions/{publicId}` runtime. Permission checks and audit logging remain service-side through the existing content admin route.
- API contract review: request JSON fields remain camelCase (`knowledgeNodePublicIds`, `tagPublicIds`), route params remain `publicId`, and response handling continues to expect `{ code, message, data, pagination? }`.
- Migration review: no schema, migration, `src/db/schema/**`, or `drizzle/**` change was made. Existing `question_knowledge_node` and `question_tag` local models are reused.

## Validation

- Passed:
  - `npm.cmd run test:unit -- tests/unit/admin-question-material-ui.test.ts`
  - `npm.cmd run test:unit`
  - `npm.cmd run test:e2e`
  - `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\agent-system\Invoke-QualityGate.ps1`
  - `npm.cmd run build`
  - `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\agent-system\Test-NamingConventions.ps1`
  - `git diff --check`
  - `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\agent-system\Test-AgentSystemReadiness.ps1`
  - `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\agent-system\Test-GitCompletionReadiness.ps1 -BaseBranch master`
- Failed then fixed/retried:
  - TDD RED focused unit failed for the expected missing UI inputs.
  - First full unit run timed out at the tool layer; rerun with longer timeout passed.
  - First quality gate failed only at `format:check`; task-scoped Prettier formatting fixed it.
- Tooling residual:
  - In-app Browser/IAB verification was attempted twice but failed during local browser runtime startup with `windows sandbox failed: spawn setup refresh`.

## Closeout Status

- Pending.
